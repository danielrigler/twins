# Twins
A randomized dual granular sample player for Monome Norns. Heavily influenced by @cfdrake's Twine and contains inspiration and code from @infinitedigits, @justmat, @artfwo, @nzimas. I would like to thank all norns community members for the lot of help I was getting on multiple channels. I'm completely new to programming and had a lot of fun hacking this together. I tried to create something which is highly playable and controllable without any external gadgets.

#### Some of the new features:
* Lush reverbs and delays
* Flexible volume control
* Tape effects
* 8 freely assignable LFOs
* Navigation
* Parameter locking
* High-pass and low-pass filters
* Subharmonics / overtones
* Lots of other smaller tweaks and features

#### Main controls:  
E1: Master Volume  
K1+E2 or K1+E3: Volume 1/2  
K1+E1: Crossfade Volumes  
K2/K3: Navigate  
E2/E3: Adjust Parameters  
K2+K3: Lock Parameters  
K2+K3: HP/LP Filter toggle  
K1+K2 or K1+K3: Randomize 1/2

Several of the features need some further love, but its useable as it is I think. Let me know what you think.
