Inspired by @cfd90â€™s Twine and contains influence and code from a lot of other norns users. This is basically Twine on steroids. A granular playground. It contains a lot of effects and extra granular parameters. You can turn off granular processing and use this as a normal sample player with effects. Live input processing is also possible. My main goal was building a tool for creating nice ambient soundscapes. And no problem if you do not have external controllers. I have tweaked the GUI and controls, so it is playable even with only a norns. Let me know if you find this useful.

**Some of the new features:**
* Reverb, delay, tape effects, shimmer, EQ, filters, bit reduction, etc.
* Flexible volume control
* Extra granular parameters, increased parameter ranges
* Smooth transition interpolation
* Freely assignable LFOs with randomization
* On screen navigation with parameter locking
* Symmetry mode and mirroring
* Live input processing

### Requirements
norns / norns shield  
_some features might require a pi4 based unit. If you hear clicks and crackles try turning off a few effects. Most expensive ones are reverb and analog tape sim_
