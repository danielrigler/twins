Heavily influenced by @cfd90's Twine and contains inspiration and code from @infinitedigits, @justmat, @artfwo, @Nuno_Zimas. I would like to thank all norns community members for the warm welcome and lot of help I was getting on multiple channels. I'm completely new to programming and had a lot of fun hacking this together. I tried to create something which is highly playable and controllable without any external gadgets. Hope it will be useful for someone.

**Some of the new features:**
* Nice reverbs and delays
* Flexible volume control
* Tape effects
* Increased parameter ranges
* Smooth interpolation
* 8 freely assignable LFOs with randomization
* Navigation
* Parameter locking
* High-pass and low-pass filters
* Subharmonics / overtones
* +Lots of other smaller tweaks and features
